# _INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING AND ITS APPLICATIONS_
## What is Programming
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. How about 23453453 X 56456?

You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. This 100 days of code series will help you learn python.

## What is Python?
- Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
- Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.
- It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.
## Features of Python
- Python is simple and easy to understand.
- It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
- Python is an open-source programming language.
- Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
- It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

## Major Applications of the Python Programming Language:
Some of the majoy applications of Python Programming in the feild of Technology are as follows:
1. **Web Development:**
   Python is used to build dynamic websites and web applications using frameworks like Django and Flask.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   Python is a go-to language for data scientists, analysts, and researchers, thanks to libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

3. **Machine Learning and AI:**
   Python's libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn make it a prominent language for creating machine learning models and AI applications.

4. **Scientific Computing:**
   Python is widely used in scientific research and engineering for simulations, numerical analysis, and solving complex mathematical problems using libraries like SciPy.

5. **Automation and Scripting:**
   Python is frequently used for automating tasks and writing scripts for various purposes, including system administration, data processing, and more.

These are just a few examples of Python's versatility and wide range of applications. Its readability, extensive libraries, and active community make it a popular choice for programmers across different domains.
