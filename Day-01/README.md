# _INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING AND ITS APPLICATIONS_
# What is Programming
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. How about 23453453 X 56456?

You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. This 100 days of code series will help you learn python.

# What is Python?
- Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
- Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.
- It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.
# Features of Python
- Python is simple and easy to understand.
- It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
- Python is an open-source programming language.
- Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
- It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.
