# Local and Global Variables in python

- Python Global variables are those which are not defined inside any function and have a global scope.
- Python local variables are those which are defined inside a function and their scope is limited to that function only. 

In other words, we can say that local variables are accessible only inside the function in which it was initialized whereas the global variables are accessible throughout the program and inside every function.
