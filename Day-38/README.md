# Local and Global Variables in python

- Python Global variables are those which are not defined inside any function and have a global scope.
- Python local variables are those which are defined inside a function and their scope is limited to that function only. 

In other words, we can say that local variables are accessible only inside the function in which it was initialized whereas the global variables are accessible throughout the program and inside every function.

## Python Local Variables

"Local variables in Python are those which are initialized inside a function and belong only to that particular function. It cannot be accessed anywhere outside the function."

- ### Creating a Local Variable

To create a local variable in Python, we simply need to assign a value to a variable inside a function. We can do this by using the assignment operator (=).

```python
def func():
    x = 7
    print(x)

func()
```

Output:

```python
7
```

- **Q. Can a Local Variable be accessed outside the function?**

Ans. No, a local variable cannot be accessed outside the function. If we try to access a local variable outside the function, it will give an error.

```python
def func():
    x = 7
    print(x)

func()
print(x)
```

Output:

```python
7
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 6, in <module>
    print(x)
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

## Python Global Variables

These are those which are defined outside any function and which are accessible throughout the program, i.e., inside and outside of every function. 

Letâ€™s see how to create a Python global variable.

- ### Creating a Global Variable

To create a global variable in Python, we simply need to assign a value to a variable outside a function. We can do this by using the assignment operator (=).

```python
x = 7

def func():
    print(x)

func()
print(x)
```

Output:

```python
7
7
```

### Why do we use Local and Global Variables?

- **Local Variables:** Local variables are used to store temporary information. They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function returns. They are accessible only inside the function in which they are defined.

- **Global Variables:** Global variables are used to store information which is to be used throughout the program. They are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program ends. They are accessible throughout the program.

## The global Keyword

- The global keyword is used to create a global variable inside a function. It is used to create a global variable and make changes to the variable in a local context.

- If we want to create a global variable inside a function, we can do so by using the global keyword. We can also use the global keyword to make changes to the global variable inside a function.

```python
x = 7

def func():
    global x
    x = 8
    print(x)

func()
print(x)
```

Output:

```python
8
8
```
