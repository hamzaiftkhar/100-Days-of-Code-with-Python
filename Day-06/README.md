# How to Take User Input and Type Casting in Python

Developers often have a need to interact with users, either to get data or to provide some sort of result. Most programs today use a dialog box as a way of asking the user to provide some type of input. While Python provides us with two inbuilt functions to read the input from the keyboard. 

- **input ( prompt )**
- **raw_input ( prompt )**

## **input ()**:
 This function first takes the input from the user and converts it into a string. The type of the returned object always will be **<class â€˜strâ€™>**. It does not evaluate the expression it just returns the complete statement as String. 

**For example**, Python provides a built-in function called input which takes the input from the user. When the input function is called it stops the program and waits for the userâ€™s input. When the user presses enter, the program resumes and returns what the user typed. 

**Example 1: How input() works in Python?**

```python
# Program to check input
# type in Python

num = input ("Enter number :")
print(num)
name1 = input("Enter name : ")
print(name1)
```
Output:

```python
Enter number :10
10
Enter name : Hamza
Hamza
```
### How the input function works in Python : 
 
- When **input()** function executes program flow will be stopped until the user has given input.
- The text or message displayed on the output screen to ask a user to enter an input value is optional i.e. the prompt, which will be printed on the screen is optional.
- Whatever you enter as input, the input function converts it into a string. if you enter an integer value still input() function converts it into a string. You need to explicitly convert it into an integer in your code using **typecasting**(Explain below in this article ðŸ‘‡).
