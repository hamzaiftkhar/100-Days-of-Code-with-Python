# Recursion in Python

## What is Recursion?

Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.

## Properties of Recursion:
Recursion has some important properties. Some of which are mentioned below:

- The primary property of recursion is the ability to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems, each of which can be solved in the same way.
- A recursive function must have a base case or stopping criteria to avoid infinite recursion.
- Recursion involves calling the same function within itself, which leads to a call stack.
- Recursive functions may be less efficient than iterative solutions in terms of memory and performance.
