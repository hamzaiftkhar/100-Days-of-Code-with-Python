# Exception Handling in Python

Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions. Errors are problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which change the normal flow of the program. 

## Different types of exceptions in python

In Python, there are several built-in exceptions that can be raised when an error occurs during the execution of a program. Here are some of the most common types of exceptions in Python:

- **SyntaxError:** This exception is raised when the interpreter encounters a syntax error in the code, such as a misspelled keyword, a missing colon, or an unbalanced parenthesis.
- **TypeError:** This exception is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of the wrong type, such as adding a string to an integer.
- **NameError:** This exception is raised when a variable or function name is not found in the current scope.
- **IndexError:** This exception is raised when an index is out of range for a list, tuple, or other sequence types.
- **KeyError:** This exception is raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.
- **ValueError:** This exception is raised when a function or method is called with an invalid argument or input, such as trying to convert a string to an integer when the string does not represent a valid integer.
- **AttributeError:** This exception is raised when an attribute or method is not found on an object, such as trying to access a non-existent attribute of a class instance.
- **IOError:** This exception is raised when an I/O operation, such as reading or writing a file, fails due to an input/output error.
- **ZeroDivisionError:** This exception is raised when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero.
- **ImportError:** This exception is raised when an import statement fails to find or load a module.

These are just a few examples of the many types of exceptions that can occur in Python. Itâ€™s important to handle exceptions properly in your code using try-except blocks or other error-handling techniques, in order to gracefully handle errors and prevent the program from crashing.

## Difference between Syntax Error and Exception

Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement. Observe the following example:

```python
# Syntax Error
if a < 3
    print(a)
```

The above code will give the following error:

```python
  File "<ipython-input-1-8b1a6e5c4c2b>", line 2
    if a < 3
            ^

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

As you can see, the parser detected the error and raised a SyntaxError before executing the code. This is because the parser cannot understand the statement if it is not syntactically correct.

- On the other hand, exceptions occur when syntactically correct Python code results in an error. Observe the following example:

```python
# Exception
a = 1
b = "2"
c = a + b
```

The above code will give the following error:

```python
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-8b1a6e5c4c2b> in <module>
      2 a = 1
      3 b = "2"
----> 4 c = a + b

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

As you can see, the code is syntactically correct, but the addition operation is not supported between an integer and a string. This results in a TypeError exception.
