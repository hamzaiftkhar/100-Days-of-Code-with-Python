# Exception Handling in Python

Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions. Errors are problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which change the normal flow of the program. 

## Different types of exceptions in python

In Python, there are several built-in exceptions that can be raised when an error occurs during the execution of a program. Here are some of the most common types of exceptions in Python:

- **SyntaxError:** This exception is raised when the interpreter encounters a syntax error in the code, such as a misspelled keyword, a missing colon, or an unbalanced parenthesis.
- **TypeError:** This exception is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of the wrong type, such as adding a string to an integer.
- **NameError:** This exception is raised when a variable or function name is not found in the current scope.
- **IndexError:** This exception is raised when an index is out of range for a list, tuple, or other sequence types.
- **KeyError:** This exception is raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.
- **ValueError:** This exception is raised when a function or method is called with an invalid argument or input, such as trying to convert a string to an integer when the string does not represent a valid integer.
- **AttributeError:** This exception is raised when an attribute or method is not found on an object, such as trying to access a non-existent attribute of a class instance.
- **IOError:** This exception is raised when an I/O operation, such as reading or writing a file, fails due to an input/output error.
- **ZeroDivisionError:** This exception is raised when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero.
- **ImportError:** This exception is raised when an import statement fails to find or load a module.

These are just a few examples of the many types of exceptions that can occur in Python. Itâ€™s important to handle exceptions properly in your code using try-except blocks or other error-handling techniques, in order to gracefully handle errors and prevent the program from crashing.
