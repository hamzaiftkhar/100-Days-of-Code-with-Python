# Variables and Data Types in Python 

## Variables in Python

**Variable** - an instance of a data type class, represented by a unique name within the code, that stores changeable values of the specific data type.

```python
    # variable declaration
    variable_name = value
```
Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.

Variable is like a container that holds data. Very similar to how our containers in kitchen holds sugar, salt etc Creating a variable is like creating a placeholder in memory and assigning it some value. In Python its as easy as writing:

```python
    a = 10
    b = True
    c = "Harry"
    d = None
 ```
These are four variables of different data types.
