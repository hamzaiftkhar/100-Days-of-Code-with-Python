"""
A text file named "matter.txt" contains some text, which needs to be displayed such that every next character is separated by a symbol "#". Write a function definition for hash_display() in Python that would display the entire content of the file matter.txt in the desired format.

```
Test Case:
If the file "matter.txt" contains the following lines:

Hello World

Output:
H#e#l#l#o# #W#o#r#l#d
```
"""

# Code:

#Create a file matter.txt and write the following lines in it

# text = ["Hello World"]

# file = open("matter.txt","w")
# for line in text:
#     file.write(line+"\n")
# file.close()

# def hash_display():
#     file = open("matter.txt","r")
#     data = file.read()
#     for char in data:
#         print(char,end="#")
#     file.close()

# hash_display()
