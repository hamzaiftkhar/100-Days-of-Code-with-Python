## Print() function

The print() function is used to display information on the screen. It is a built-in function in Python.

 We will use this function frequently in this series to check the results of your code. The syntax of the print() function is modeled in the example below:

```python
# Syntax for printing a string of text.

print("Hello forks! its Day-05 of 100DaysOfCode Challenge.")
```
Output:

```python
Hello forks! its Day-05 of 100DaysOfCode Challenge.
```
