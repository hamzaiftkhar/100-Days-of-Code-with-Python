## Our Third Challenge Exercise

### Question-1:

Write a program to print the following star pattern using the for loop?

```

### Question-3:

We are making n stone piles! The first pile has n stones. If n is even, then all piles have an even number of stones. If n is odd, all piles have an odd number of stones. Each pile must more stones than the previous pile but as few as possible. Write a Python program to find the number of stones in each pile.

Test Data:

```
Input: 2
Output:
[2, 4]

Input: 10
Output:
[10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28]
```

### Question-4:

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

Write a Python program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term using recursive function.

Test Data:

```
Input: 5
Output: 0 1 1 2 3   

Input: 10
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

### Question-5:

Write a recursive function to print the reverse of a given string. 

Test Data:

```
Input: Hello
Output: olleH

Input: 123456789
Output: 987654321
```
