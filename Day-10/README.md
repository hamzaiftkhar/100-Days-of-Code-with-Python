# Exploring Python String Manipulation: Indexing, Slicing, and Essential Methods

The Python string data type is a sequence made up of one or more individual characters that could consist of letters, numbers, whitespace characters, or symbols. As the string is a sequence, it can be accessed in the same ways that other sequence-based data types are, through indexing and slicing.

## String Indexing 
Indexing means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within the iterable. Each of a stringâ€™s characters corresponds to an index number and each character can be accessed using its index number. We can access characters in a String in Two ways :

- Accessing Characters by Positive Index Number
- Accessing Characters by Negative Index Number

#### 1. Accessing Characters by Positive Index Number:
 In this type of Indexing, we pass a Positive index(which we want to access) in square brackets. The index number starts from index number 0 (which denotes the first character of a string).

```python
# Python program to demonstrate
# accessing of characters in a string

str = "python"
print("str = ", str)

#first character
print("str[0] = ", str[0])

#third character
print("str[2] = ", str[2])

```
Output:
```python
str =  python
str[0] =  p
str[2] =  t
```
#### 2. Accessing Characters by Negative Index Number:

In this type of Indexing, we pass the Negative index(which we want to access) in square brackets. Here the index number starts from index number -1 (which denotes the last character of a string).
    
```python
# Python program to demonstrate
# accessing of characters in a string

str = "python"

#last character
print("str[-1] = ", str[-1])

#3rd last character
print("str[-3] = ", str[-3])
```
Output:
```python
str[-1] =  n
str[-3] =  h
```

## String Slicing

Slicing in Python is a feature that enables accessing parts of sequences like strings, tuples, and lists. You can also use them to modify or delete the items of mutable sequences such as lists (later concept).

Syntax of slicing is

```python
string[start : end : step]

- start : We provide the starting index.
- end : We provide the end index(this is not included in substring).
- step : It is an optional argument that determines the increment between each index for slicing.
```

```python
# declaring the string
str ="100-Days-of-Code-with-Python"

# slicing using indexing sequence
print(str[: 3])
print(str[1 : 5 : 2])
print(str[-1 : -12 : -2])
```

Output:
```python
100
00D
nhyCf-oe
```

#### Reverse a String using Slicing

```python
# declaring the string
str ="100-Days-of-Code-with-Python"

print("Original String :-")
print(str)

# reversing the string using slicing
print("Reverse String :-")
print(str[: : -1])
```

Output:
```python
Original String :-
100-Days-of-Code-with-Python
Reverse String :-
nohtyP-htiw-edoC-fo-syaD-001
```

## Basic String Methods

Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.
