# Functions in Python

Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.

Some Benefits of Using Functions :

- Increase Code Reusability
- Increase Code Readability

### Python Function Declaration

In Python, we declare a function using the def keyword. After the keyword, we specify the name of the function along with parentheses. The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.

```python
def function_name():
    # code block
```

## Types of Functions

There are two types of functions in Python:

- Built-in Functions
- User-defined Functions

### Built-in Functions

Python has several built-in functions. These functions are already defined in Python libraries and can be used directly by the user.
These functions are defined and pre-coded in python. Some examples of built-in functions are as follows:

min(), max(), len(), sum(), type(), range(), dict(), list(), tuple(), set(), print(), etc.
