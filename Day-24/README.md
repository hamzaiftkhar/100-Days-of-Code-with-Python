## Python List Slicing

The format for list slicing is of Python List Slicing is as follows:

```
Lst[ Initial : End : IndexJump ]
```

If Lst is a list, then the above expression returns the portion of the list from index Initial to index End, at a step size IndexJump.

List slicing in Python is a common practice and can be used both with positive indexes as well as negative indexes.

```python
# Initialize list
Lst = [50, 70, 30, 20, 90, 10, 50]

# Display list
print(Lst[1:5])
```

Output:

```
[70, 30, 20, 90]
```

Example 2:

```python
# Initialize list
List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Show original list
print("Original List:\n", List)

print("\nSliced Lists: ")

# Display sliced list
print(List[3:9:2])

# Display sliced list
print(List[::2])

# Display sliced list
print(List[::])
```

Output:

```
Original List:
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Sliced Lists: 
[4, 6, 8]
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## List Methods in Python

Python List Methods has multiple methods to work with Python lists, Below weâ€™ve explained all the methods you can use with Python lists, for example, append(), copy(), insert(), and more.

| S.no | Method   | Description                                         |
| ---- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `append()`   | Used for appending and adding elements to the end of the List. |
| 2    | `copy()`     | It returns a shallow copy of a list. |
| 3    | `clear()`    | This method is used for removing all items from the list. |
| 4    | `count()`    | Counts the elements. |
| 5    | `extend()`   | Adds each element of the iterable to the end of the List. |
| 6    | `index()`    | Returns the lowest index where the element appears. |
| 7    | `insert()`   | Inserts a given element at a given index in a list. |
| 8    | `pop()`      | Removes and returns the last value from the List or the given index value. |
| 9    | `remove()`   | Removes a given object from the List. |
| 10   | `reverse()`  | Reverses objects of the List in place. |
| 11   | `sort()`     | Sorts a List in ascending, descending, or user-defined order. |
| 12   | `min()`      | Calculates the minimum of all the elements of the List. |
| 13   | `max()`      | Calculates the maximum of all the elements of the List. |
