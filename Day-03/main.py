# Our First Python Program with single line comment

print("Hello World!")

# Output: Hello World!

print(4 + 5)
# Output: 9

print(9 * 7)
# Output: 63

print()
# Output: (blank line)
#----------------------------------------------------------

# Example-2: Multi-line comment
#Like C, Python supports multi-line comments as well.
# All characters between the "#" character and the end of the physical line are part of the comment, and the Python interpreter ignores them. In this way we can also add multiline comments in Python.

"""" This is a multiline
comment. I can write as many lines as I want
and it will not affect the code """
print("Here above we can see a multiline comment.")

# Output: Here above we can see a multiline comment.

# Output: She said, "What's there?"

# escaping double quotes
print("She said, \"What's there?\"")
# Output: She said, "What's there?"

# using newline character
print("Hello\nWe are learning Python")
# Output:
# Hello
# We are learning Python

# using tab character
print("Hello\t Welcome to Day 3")
# Output: Hello   Welcome to Day 3

# using backslash
print("This will insert \\ (backslash)")
# Output: This will insert \ (backslash)

# printing path
