Program Takes the input from the user for two numbers and perform all the arithmetic operation described in 
[Day-05](https://github.com/hamzaiftkhar/100-Days-of-Code-with-Python/tree/main/Day-05)
exercise and print all results on screen with formatted text.

2. ### Task-02  (  Create a BMI Calculator )

Create a BMI calculator that reads the user's weight in kilograms and height in meters, then calculates and displays the user's body mass index.

The BMI formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared.

3.  ### Task-03  ( Give me a discount )

Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first should be the full price of an item as an integer. The second should be the discount percentage as an integer.

The function should return the price of the item after the discount has been applied. For example, if the price is 100 and the discount is 20, the function should return 80.
