# Python Installation Modules and Pips in Python

Python is a high-level programming language that has become increasingly popular due to its simplicity, versatility, and extensive range of applications. 
The process of installing Python on the Windows operating system is relatively easy and involves a few uncomplicated steps. This article aims to take you through the process of downloading and installing Python on your Windows computer.

## Modules in Python

Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python:

- **Built in Modules** - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
- **External Modules** - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.

## Pips in Python

It can be used as a package manager pip to install a python module. Lets install a module called pandas using the following command:
           
     pip install pandas

## How to use Modules in Python

Using modules in Python is essential for utilizing pre-built code and organizing your own code into reusable components. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use modules in Python:

**1. Importing Modules:**

To use a module in your Python script, you need to import it using the import statement. There are a few ways to import a module:

a. Import the entire module:

    import module_name

b. Import specific items from the module:

    from module_name import item_name

c. Import an entire module as an alias:

    import module_name as alias_name

**2. Importing Multiple Items:**

You can import multiple items from a module using a comma-separated list:
    
    from module_name import first_item, second_item

**3. Using Your Own Modules:**

You can also create your own modules to organize your code. To use a module you've created, make sure the module file is in the same directory as your script or in a directory included in Python's module search path. Then, import your module in the same way as importing built-in modules.

**4. Standard Library Modules:**

Python comes with a rich standard library containing modules for various purposes. Some common ones include os, datetime, random, json, and csv. You can find more information about available standard library modules in the Python [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).

We will find ourselved doing this often in the later part of this series. So, it is important to know how to use modules in Python.
